        <p>Hello, my name is Jéssica Kaliely, i'm 26 years old, I'm from Brazil, São Paulo. Currently, I'm an Interior Design, and I realy like to study colors, the strategy for organize the space with better furniture placement. I'm married and I'm 6 months pregnant and and it's been a very different experience.</p>
        <p>My degree is Software Development and a like the code and the logic in this universe, but I need develop a way to put together my first lineup if that's the case. I served a mission in Recife - 2017-2018 and I like escape games and puzzles, in addition to researching various subjects.</p>
